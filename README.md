## an introduction
My name is Justin, and I'm a computer science student at **[REDACTED]**,
functional programmer, and core collaborator to the
[PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript) compiler.

I initially got into programming through Python, and over the next few years, I
eventually learned and fell in love with functional programming languages.

I'm currently using Rust on top of Haskell and PureScript mostly as a hobby,
although I'm open to career opportunities.

You can contact me over at `functor at duck.com`.

## projects and things
Most of my projects live under my @PureFunctor handle.
