## an introduction
My name is [...] and I'm currently a computer science student at [...]. I'm a fully self-taught programmer,
and over the past few years, I've managed to teach myself a variety of languages. This ultimately led to my
journey towards functional programming and theoretical computer science; at the moment, I'm using and learning
a variety of functional languages, namely:

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
* [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/)
* [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
* [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/)

## other stuff
Most of the repositories in this profile are for academic work. The [@vtrl](https://github.com/vtrl) organization
houses most of the software that I actually write in my free time.

## quick tech opinions
Here's a few of my opinions regarding tech topics. I also elaborate upon them [here](https://twitter.com/vitriol_moe), sometimes.

* blockchain technologies are impractical at most
  * _this includes cryptocurrencies, nfts, and web3_

* developing a new programming language should also mean developing tools
  * _everybody wants to write a compiler, but nobody wants to write an ide_

* statically typed languages should be the norm; likewise, linear types should be more mainstream
  * _in tandem, you get [type-driven development](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris),
    which often comes with easily verifiably correct software_

* editor/distro/language wars are futile and unproductive
  * _let people use what they want, engaging in such activities is useless otherwise_

* object-oriented programming is a mess of ideas
  * _software was never about how tables and chairs are furniture, but not one another_
