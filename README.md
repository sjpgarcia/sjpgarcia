## an introduction
My name is [...] and I'm currently a computer science student at [...]. I'm a fully self-taught programmer,
and over the past few years, I've managed to teach myself a variety of languages. This ultimately led to my
journey towards functional programming and theoretical computer science; at the moment, I'm using and learning
a variety of functional languages, namely:

* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
* [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/)
* [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/)
* [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/)

## other stuff
Most of the repositories in this profile are for academic work. The [@vtrl](https://github.com/vtrl) organization
houses most of the software that I actually write in my free time.

## tech opinions
[I tweet, sometimes.](https://twitter.com/vitriol_moe) Blockchain is a solution looking for a problem and Web3 is a pyramid scheme.
